This is the place I share my QT and QML related works.

## Game Controller Enhancement Project:
I got this job from Upwork. My client was looking for someone who has knowledge about C++, game controllers and signal processing. Luckly, what my client needed was very similar to what I accomplished during pandemic lockdown (it was a motion based game controller project, like Nintendo wii)

Together we started from beginning and made a complete product that has all functionalities he needs, simple and beautiful UI, subscription system integrated to Woo Commerce API. 

Techs, methods & tools I used in this project:
- C++
- QT
- QML
- SDL2
- Woo Commerce (API Integraton)
- Code Signing
- Figma
- Signal Processing
